### Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a machine learning engineer looking for work in AI alignment. 

Previously, I participated in SERI MATS 2022 winter program, worked at DeepSpin in Germany, worked at rebels.ai and MainsLab in Russia.
I got my Masters degree in Data Science from Skoltech and my Bachelors degree in Mathematics from HSE.

Most of my code contributions are in private repositories at MainsLab and Deepspin, but I created a few small projects to showcase my coding skills.
[PGRD](https://github.com/malyasova/PGRD/) - I reproduce the first experiment from a reinforcement learning paper [Reward Design via Online Gradient Ascent](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2010/file/168908dd3227b8358eababa07fcaf091-Paper.pdf)
The goal of the experiment is to find an optimal reward function to train reinforcement learning agents.
[intersect_circles](https://github.com/malyasova/intersect_circles) - to get some practice with Red-Black trees, I implemented the Bentley-Ottmann sweep line algorithm in C++, but with a twist: instead of finding all intersection of segments, I find all intersections of a set of circles
[Voice Conversion](https://github.com/malyasova/VoiceConversion) - a one-shot voice conversion model I trained as a student at Skoltech.
[malyasova.github.io](https://malyasova.github.io/) - some blog posts about data structures and algorithms and their implementation in Python: Augmented Binary Search Tree, Augmented Red-Black Tree, Fenwick Tree,  Heap, Quickselect Algorithm, Rivest-Floyd algorithm
